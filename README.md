# youtube-shorts-controls

A browser extension to add controls to youtube shorts.

It also implements going 5 seconds forward or backwards with the arrowkeys.

The info icon spawning on top of the reels is a toggle button to toggle the overlay (reel title, subtitle, channel name, ...) to be able to properly click on the controls overlay.
